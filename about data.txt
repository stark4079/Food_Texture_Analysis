Texture measurements of a pastry-type food.
Data source:	
Oil: percentage oil in the pastry
Density: the productâ€™s density (the higher the number, the more dense the product)
Crispy: a crispiness measurement, on a scale from 7 to 15, with 15 being more crispy.
Fracture: the angle, in degrees, through which the pasty can be slowly bent before it fractures.
Hardness: a sharp point is used to measure the amount of force required before breakage occurs.
Simulated data, but has the characteristics from an industrial problem.
